### Bio

I'm a third-year student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I study and research mathematics -- Fair Machine Learning, Statistical Physics, and Dynamical Systems.

My interests are at the intersection of Computational and Applied Mathematics, and the development and application of mathematical theory to support mathematical computing. 

I've had graduate coursework in Linear Algebra & Calculus, ODE Systems, Machine Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Computational Biology. I describe more of my coursework [here](courses.qmd).

I've been an Undergraduate Researcher at: 

1. **Fair and Explainable Decision-Making Lab, UMass CS**
2. **PALM Research Lab, Brown University CS** (with an NSF Undergraduate Fellowship!)
3. **Machta Research Group, UMass Physics**

Additionally, I've TA-ed the following courses at UMass:

1. **Pre-Calculus** (Math 100, 101)
2. **Computational Physics** (Physics 281)
3. **Artificial Intelligence** (CS 383)
4. **Introduction to the Theory of Computation** (CS 250)
