## Who I am

Hiya, I'm Shreyas! I'm a third-year student studying **Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am an Undergraduate Researcher at the **Fair and Explainable Decision-Making Lab**, and I also delve in some Statistical Physics research with the **Machta Research Group at UMass**.

Previously, I've been a Undergraduate Research Fellow at **Brown University**.

At any point in time, you'll find me:

+ studying math / solving a math problem set
+ fighting to download my jupyter notebook files as pdfs
+ petting cats
+ trying to be the kindest I can be


## What I do
My interests in Mathematics are broad, and I would say much of what I do aspires to:

1. Describe physical phenomena quantitatively and robustly
2. Drive Computer Science practice with a strong justification in Mathematical theory

In concrete terms, I'm mostly engaged in:

1. **Scientific Computing** - with C++, Python and Julia
2. **Machine Learning and Data Science**
3. **Dynamical Systems**

You might know me from:

* **UMass** -- I'm involved in Undergraduate Research and Teaching.
    + My research is in Theoretical Machine Learning, Statistical Physics and broadly Applied Math in general.
    + I've been a TA for **Pre-Calculus** courses, **Computational Physics** (Phy 281), **Artificial Intelligence** (CS 383).
    + Since Fall 2023, I'm a Residential Peer Mentor in Wheeler Hall.
* **Brown University** -- I've worked with Dr Chen Sun at Brown University's **PALM ðŸŒ´ Research Lab** in the Summer of 2023.
* **The Leadership Alliance** -- I'm a member of the 2023 cohort of the Leadership Alliance's Summer Research Early Identification Program.
* Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School / Hiranandani Foundation School, Thane, India.

[Here](./courses.qmd)'s a list of courses I've taken at UMass and any important materials I've produced in them.
